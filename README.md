## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**calebahetrick/calebahetrick** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently serving as Director of Student Experience at University of the Cumberlands.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Power BI.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on easy projects to get used to the real world of code. 

- âš¡ Fun fact: I can ride a unicycle with a kid on my shoulders or juggle with my eyes closed.
