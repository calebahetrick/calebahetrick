## Howdy!
My name is Caleb Hetrick. I’m currently serving as Director of Student Experience at University of the Cumberlands.

Right now, I’m working on learning Python and Power BI. I’m looking to collaborate on easy projects to get used to the real world of code. 

Fun fact: I can ride a unicycle with a kid on my shoulders or juggle with my eyes closed.
